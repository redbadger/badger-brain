# Badger Brain

GraphQL server for all Red Badger related data.

This project is public. No sensitive data should be committed to the repository.

## Ideas

This server will provide GraphQL endpoint for fetching and consuming company related data. Much like in the famous [Stevey's Google Platforms Rant](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611) we should be able to have an interface for communicating company data for whoever decides to consume it.

List of consumers so far:

* red-badger.com site

List of data providers:

* Workable
* Prismic.io
