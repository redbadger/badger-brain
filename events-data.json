We will look at how React’s one way data flow can be complemented by Firebase’s API to create live, collaborative web applications quickly and easily. We will also look at Firebase’s ReactFire mixin, which aims to further reduce the need for boilerplate code when working with React. \n\n__Our final presenter is [Brad Shuttleworth](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/bradley-shuttleworth/1/385/492), Tech Lead at MOO.__ MOO is migrating its complex editing tools from Flash to HTML5, powered by React.  Brad will talk about the process, the tech and the outcomes, and might even do a live demo of the beta.  Subjects include complex designs, immutability and performance. ",

Even if you don't use both together you want to be able to apply their ideas in any context. In pursuit of this, Jamie will try writing the same simple app in both frameworks and see where the sweet spots are.\n\n##Diff-ing Algorithms and React \n\n__[Rob Knight](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/robert-knight/), Software Engineer at [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/)__ \n\nReact is able to update UI components efficiently in response to data changes thanks to a virtual DOM and a diff-ing algorithm which are used to determine the minimal changes that need to be made to the real HTML document to make it match the current state of the React component. \nRob will explain the basics of how diff-ing algorithms work in \ngeneral terms, how it works in the context of React and the features of React that allow it to be efficient when re-rendering a large UI.\n\n##React and the importance isomorphic SPAs\n\n__Markus Kobler, Founder at [cohesive.io](http://www.cohesive.io/)__\n\nSingle page apps are ever more popular at but they are often at the cost of poor SEO and slow load times. Built to deliver responsive client and server experiences at Facebook scale we walk though how React can address these issues to create better user experiences.\n\n",

Are you being encouraged to present at brown bags / tech sessions at work?  Or maybe you need to present something to management or to the team? Or speak at a Ladies who Code meetup?\n\nAre you tired of hearing about the lack of women speaking at conferences and want to do something about it?\n\nThis session is aimed at NOVICE speakers - people who have never done it before, or have limited experience with presenting, who want to take that first step.\n\nWe will cover the basics - give you some simple guidelines to help prepare you for your first presentation.  The most important thing you should get out of this session is: how to deal with a sea of faces staring expectantly at you.\n\n###Come to this session if:\n\n- You'd like to present at a Ladies Who Code meetup, but you're not confident enough yet\n\n- You're wondering if you could present at conferences\n\n- You want practical help getting started with public speaking\n\n- Your job might need you to present something, even to a small audience\n\n- Or you're simply curious about what it's like\n\nThis is very much an introductory session (although more confident speakers are welcome), and will focus on your skills as a presenter, not the mechanics of building a slide deck or talk.\n\n__[Trisha Gee](https://twitter.com/trisha_gee)__ will lead the workshop.\n\n",

Learning it can be a bit of a challenge though, especially if you haven't worked with flux and/or functional programming before. During this talk, you'll learn a little bit of both, and see how Redux is built using some key principles of these simple yet amazing ideas.\n\n###About Anna\nAnna is a passionate programmer with particular interest in React, Redux, and functional programming. She's currently working for Red Badger where she's using these tools, node and ES6 to develop modern Javascript applications.\n",
